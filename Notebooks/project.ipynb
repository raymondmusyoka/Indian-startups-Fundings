    "# Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis\n",
    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "Ideas, creativity, and execution are essential for a start-up to flourish. But are they enough? Investors provide start-ups and other entrepreneurial ventures with the capital---popularly known as \"funding\"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. In this project, I am  going to analyse funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. I will find the data for each year of funding in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files I'll find the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.\n",

    "## Business Questions:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. How have the trends in funding amounts varied among different sectors of Indian startups from 2018 to 2021, and what implications do these trends have for investors seeking to optimize their investment strategies in the Indian startup ecosystem?\n",
    "  2. What were the top sectors in the Indian startup ecosystem that received the highest total funding from 2018 to 2021, and what factors contributed to their success in attracting investment compared to other sectors? This question delves into not just the identification of the sectors but also seeks to understand the underlying reasons for their success in attracting funding, which could include factors like market demand, technological innovation, regulatory environment, and investor interest.\n",
    "   3. What are the specific funding trends across different stages of startup development (early-stage, growth-stage, late-stage) within the Indian startup ecosystem, and how do factors such as sector, geographic location, and investor type influence these trends? This refined question allows for a more comprehensive analysis of funding trends by considering additional dimensions such as: Startup Stages: Early-stage, growth-stage, and late-stage. Sector: Identifying which sectors are receiving funding at various stages. Geographic Location: Understanding regional variations in funding. Investor Type: Examining the role of different types of investors (e.g., venture capital, angel investors, private equity) in funding trends. \n",
    "   4. What specific geographic factors (such as infrastructure, talent pool, economic policies, and market access) influence the correlation between the geographical location of startups and the funding they received within the Indian startup ecosystem, and how do these factors vary across different regions? \n",
    "   5. What specific factors (such as the amount and stage of funding, investor involvement, business model, and market conditions) influence the relationship between funding amounts and the subsequent success or failure of startups within the Indian ecosystem, and how do these factors vary across different sectors and stages of startup development?\n",
    "## Hypothesis to Test:\n",
    " \n",
    "Given the goal of assessing the investment potential in the Indian startup ecosystem, we hypothesize that:\n",
    " \n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no clear pattern in the funding received by Indian startups from 2018 to 2021, and factors like sector, stage, location, and funding amount do not affect startup success. \n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a clear pattern in the funding received by Indian startups from 2018 to 2021, and factors like sector, stage, location, and funding amount affect startup success.\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. To assess the overall attractiveness of the Indian startup ecosystem based on funding trends and investor activity from 2018 to 2021.\n",
    "2. To identify key sectors with high potential for investment based on their funding attractiveness and growth prospects.\n",
    "3. To evaluate the investment opportunities across different stages of startup development and their risk-return profiles.\n",
    "4. To analyze the geographical distribution of startups and funding to identify strategic investment locations and regional investment disparities.\n",
    "5. To determine the correlation between funding amounts received by startups and their subsequent performance, providing insights into potential returns on investment and success rates.\n",
    " \n",
    "These objectives aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the investment landscape in the Indian startup ecosystem, helping the team make informed decisions regarding the feasibility and potential of investing in Indian startups."
